The goal of `{geoprofiler}` is to get distances along and across user-defined 
profile lines or transects. This is useful to visualize the distance-dependency 
of some variables in the geosciences.

![](man/figures/fig.png)

The concept of `{geoprofiler}` is a coordinate transformation of your 
geo-coordinates into "profile coordinates". These coordinates are the 
distances along and across your profile.

## Installation

You must have R installed on your system (see <https://www.r-project.org/>).
To install `{geoprofiler}` from CRAN, type the following code at the R
command line prompt:

```         
install.packages("tectonicr")
```

The most recent development version of `{geoprofiler}` is available from
from [GitHub](https://github.com/) and can be installed on your system as follows:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tobiste/geoprofiler")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to create a profile.

```{r example}
library(geoprofiler)
library(ggplot2)
```

Import example data and transfer them into a `sf` object:

```{r quakes}
data(quakes)
quakes_sf <- sf::st_as_sf(quakes, coords = c("long", "lat"), crs = "WGS84")
```

Create a profile line from two known points:

```{r profile}
profile <- data.frame(lon = c(160, -170), lat = c(-15, -30)) |>
  sf::st_as_sf(coords = c("lon", "lat"), crs = "WGS84") |>
  sf::st_shift_longitude() |>
  profile_line()
```

> Note: You can also create a profile line by a direction via `profile_points()`

Calculate the distances of all points along and across the profile line:

```{r cooridnates}
quakes_profile <- profile_coords(quakes_sf, profile = profile) |>
  dplyr::bind_cols(quakes_sf)
```

Finally, create your profile plot:

```{r plot}
ggplot(quakes_profile, aes(X, depth, color = mag, size = abs(Y), alpha = abs(Y))) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_viridis_c("Richter magnitude", option = "A") +
  scale_size_continuous(bquote("Distance from profile (" * degree * ")"), range = c(3, .1)) +
  scale_alpha_continuous(bquote("Distance from profile (" * degree * ")"), range = c(1, .1)) +
  scale_y_reverse() +
  scale_x_continuous(guide = guide_axis(position = "top")) +
  labs(x = bquote("Distance along profile (" * degree * ")"), y = "Depth (km)") +
  theme_classic()
```

The above example uses the `quakes` dataset giving the locations of 1000 seismic
events of MB \> 4.0. The events occurred in a cube near Fiji since 1964.
